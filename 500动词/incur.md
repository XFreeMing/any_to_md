1. The evolutionary theory may also be criticized on the grounds that from the plaintiff’s perspective, legal relief may always be perceived as belonging to the domain of gains (see subsection 3.2). It nevertheless remains true that people who incurred a loss are more strongly motivated to seek legal redress than people who failed to obtain a gain. (Zamir, 2014)

  

2. He who uses things improperly harms other men and incurs God’s displeasure, and he who displeases God is a fool if he thinks he is happy. (Fiero, 2011)

  

3. The damage to the portrait was probably incurred during the Medes invasion of Nineveh in 612 bce. The enemy gouged out its eyes and hacked off its ears, nose, and lower beard, as if attacking the person represented.  (Davies et al., 2015)

  

4. A right to withdraw—be it mandatory, a default that sellers did not opt out of or a voluntary contractual design feature adopted by sellers—can be costly to imperfectly rational consumers who overestimate the benefits of such a right and underestimate the cost of exercising it. The concern is that a consumer, falsely reassured by the right to withdraw, will make a purchase that she will later come to regret. The consumer would then need to incur the cost of withdrawal or, if this cost is too high, keep the undesired good or service. (Bar-Gill, 2014)
