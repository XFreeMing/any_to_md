## 坚持；主张

1. With this restrictive illiberal background in mind, we may ask how Rousseau can maintain that he has solved the problem of finding a form of association in which 'while uniting himself with all (each associate) may still obey himself alone, and remain as free as before' (Social Contract, bk. I, ch. 6, p. 191). (Wolff, 2006)

> 考虑到这种限制性的不自由背景，我们可能会问，卢梭如何能够坚持认为他已经解决了找到一个联合形式的问题，在这个形式中，"虽然与所有人（每个联合者）联合，仍然可以只服从自己，并保持与以前一样自由"（《社会契约论》，第一卷，第六章，第191页）。

## 维持

1. Holy stature was often credited to people who built and maintained the actual roads on which pilgrims trekked, as was the case with Santo Domingo de la Calzada (literally of the paved road or roadway ), who built, in addition to a pilgrims hostel and hospital, a long bridge over the Oja River and who maintained the roads around the town that came to be named after him. (Davies et al., 2015)

2. Personal space is a sort of portable bubble or buffer zone that we like to maintain between ourselves and others. (Myers, 2012)

3. Solidarity is maintained when individuals are successfully integrated into social groups and are regulated by a set of shared values and customs. (Giddens, 2009)

4. Thus it is often claimed that the state possesses two essential features: it maintains a monopoly of legitimate coercion or violence and it offers to protect everyone within its territory.
