1. Mindful of all this research, New Jersey’s attorney general has mandated statewide blind testing (to avoid steering witnesses toward suspects) and sequential lineups (to minimize simply comparing people and choosing the person who most resembles the one they saw commit a crime). (Myers, 2012)

  

2. Finally, there is a striking feel-good/ do-good effect: Happy people are helpful people. Social norms also mandate helping. The reciprocity norm stimulates us to help those who have helped us. The social-responsibility norm beckons us to help needy people, even if they cannot reciprocate, as long as they are deserving. (Myers, 2012)

  

3. In assaults where someone had some chance to resist, those who had a gun were more than 5 times more likely to be shot. Safer nations, such as Canada and Britain, mandate domestic disarmament. (Myers, 2012)

  

4. Nevertheless, we can now anticipate techniques for reducing prejudice: If unequal status breeds prejudice, we can seek to create cooperative, equal-status relationships. If prejudice rationalizes discriminatory behavior, we can mandate nondiscrimination. If social institutions support prejudice, we can pull out those supports (for example, with media that model interracial harmony). (Myers, 2012)
