1. The play’s (Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme) fabric of deceit and self-deception is complicated by Jourdain’s refusal to accept his daughter’s choice of a partner, the handsome but poor Cléonte. (Fiero, 2011)

  

2. General unemployment statistics are also complicated by the fact that they encompass two different 'types' of unemployment. (Giddens, 2009)

  

3. Foreign intervention complicated the Spanish Civil War. Franco’s forces were aided by arms, money, and men from the fascist regimes of Italy and Germany while the government was assisted by forty thousand foreign volunteers and trucks, planes, tanks, and military advisers from the Soviet Union. (Spielvogel, 2010)
