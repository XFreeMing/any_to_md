1. The period sociologists call modernity has witnessed a much more rapid globalization of social life, connecting large-scale societies together in a whole variety of ways, from long-range economic exchanges and international political agreements to global tourism, electronic communications technology and more fluid migration patterns. In all these ways, people across the world have interconnected more and become interdependent than in previous times. (Giddens, 2009)

  

2. Decision-making within the 'New Europe' is increasingly made on the basis of multilevel governance, in which the policy process has interconnected subnational, national, intergovernmental and supranational levels, the balance between them shifting in relation to different issues and policy areas. (Heywood, 2013)

  

3. Widespread use of the Internet and mobile phones is deepening and accelerating processes of globalization; more and more people have interconnected through the use of these technologies and are doing so in places that have previously been isolated or poorly served by traditional communications. (Giddens, 2009)

  

4. Theosophists claimed that all creation is part of one eternal life, a Radical Unity, and that everything is therefore mystically interconnected. (Solomon & Higgins, 2009)
