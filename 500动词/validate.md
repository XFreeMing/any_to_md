1. Matthew Miller and his colleagues at Harvard University's School of Public Health examined the link between rates of household firearm ownership and homicide across the states over a ten-year period (1988–1997). Using a measure of gun ownership that has been validated in previous research, the researchers found that, after accounting for the effects of poverty and urbanization, people in states with high gun ownership levels had elevated rates of homicide, particularly firearm homicide.

2. Higher education in France, for instance, is organized nationally, with centralized control being almost as marked as in primary and secondary education. All course structures have to be validated by a national regulatory body responsible to the minister of higher education. (Spielvogel, 2010)

The more group members repeat one another’s ideas, the more they rehearse and validate them. (Myers, 2012)

  

4. These human-made disasters not only challenged the belief that technology would improve the quality of human life, they seemed to validate Freud’s theory that mortals are driven by base instincts and the dark forces of self-destruction. (Fiero, 2011)
