## 取代；替代

1. With the final fall of Napoleon in 1815, David (an artist), who had been named painter to the emperor in 1801, skulked off to Brussels, and the careers of all of his students had stalled at the same time, displaced by a new generation of painterly Romantic artists. (Davies et al., 2015)

2. Darwin demonstrates that careful observation and experimentation can be turned on the behavior of invertebrates, and he shows that it is possible to investigate the question of invertebrate minds scientifically. While he recognizes that this claim will seem questionable from the standpoint of commonsense psychology, he hopes to displace our unfounded prejudices about the nature of cognition with sound scientific inquiry so that the commonsense understanding of mentality can be revised to construct a plausible scientific understanding of what it takes to have a minimal mind. (Beauchamp & Frey, 2014)

> 达尔文证明，仔细的观察和实验可以应用于无脊椎动物的行为，他表明可以科学地研究无脊椎动物心灵的问题。虽然他认识到这一主张从常识心理学的角度来看似乎值得怀疑，但他希望用可靠的科学研究来取代我们对认知本质的毫无根据的偏见，这样对心理的常识理解就可以被修正，以构建一个合理的科学理解，即拥有最小心灵需要什么。

## 将…移动；引导开

1. Supposedly, he (a scientist) discovered specific gravity by observing the water he displaced in his bath and became so excited by his realization that he jumped out of the water and ran home naked, shouting "Eureka!" ("I have found it!"). (Spielvogel, 2010)

2. The earthquake shifted the seabed and displaced hundreds of cubic kilometres of water. A large wave known as a tsunami, caused by the tremor, began moving across the Indian Ocean away from the quake's epicentre at a speed of around 500 miles per hour. (Giddens, 2009)

3. The aggressive energy need not explode directly against its source. Most people learn to inhibit direct retaliation, especially when others might disapprove or punish; instead, we displace, or redirect, our hostilities to safer targets. (Myers, 2012)
