1. Religion restricts this play of choice and adaptation, since it imposes equally on everyone its own path to the acquisition of happiness and protection from suffering. Its technique consists in depressing the value of life and distorting the picture of the real world in a delusional manner—which presupposes an intimidation of the intelligence. (Fiero, 2011)

  

2. One advantage of this technique is that the artist can adjust the perspectival system to take account of the presence of a spectator. The method presupposes that a beholder’s eye occupies a fixed point in space, so that a perspective picture dictates where the viewer must stand to see it properly. (Davies et al., 2015)

  

3. Manorialism and feudalism presupposed a hierarchical, organic, and stable social order: clergy who prayed, lords who fought, and peasants who toiled. People believed that society functioned smoothly when all individuals accepted their status and performed their proper role. (Perry, 2010)

  

4. For the rich would seek a set of laws which particularly benefited them, and would have the money and influence to arrange things in their own favour. So, as we noted, Rousseau assumes that genuine democracy presupposes a classless society. (Wolff, 2006)
