1. Romanticism began to dissipate in Europe as an intellectual attitude and stylistic trend after 1848 and was gradually superseded by Realism. Increasingly, people came to rely on the physical, physiological, empirical, and scientific as a way to understand nature, society, and human behavior. (Davies et al., 2015)

  

2. Economic interdependence: The outcome of specialization and the division of labour, when self-sufficiency is superseded and individuals depend on others to produce many or most of the goods they need to sustain their lives. (Giddens, 2009)
