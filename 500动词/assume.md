1. The focus of the image is the tomb, a mausoleum for painters, as suggested by the title. We can assume the painters are German because the tomb is not painted but rendered in a large woodcut, a medium associated with German art since being widely used by northern European artists during the Renaissance as well as by the Expressionists in the early twentieth century. (Davies et al., 2015)

  

2. Music is as old as human societies and its use within societies pre-dates the development of complex languages. The first music is assumed to have come from the human voice, with instruments developing later along with different forms of material culture. (Giddens, 2009)

  

3. Shy, anxious people overpersonalize situations, a tendency that breeds anxious concern and, in extreme cases, paranoia. They also overestimate the extent to which other people are watching and evaluating them. If their hair won’t comb right or they have a facial blemish, they assume everyone else notices and judges them accordingly. (Myers, 2012)

  

4. The implications of Locke’s principles of knowledge moved European and (later) American thought to assume an optimistic view of human destiny. (Fiero, 2011)
