1. The German physiologist Wilhelm Wundt (1832 - 1920) transformed psychology from a philosophy to a natural science by basing it on scientific method, which he detailed in his 1874 Principles of Physiological Psychology. Meanwhile, the research of the Russian Ivan Pavlov (1849 - 1936) sparked an intense interest in how human behavior is conditioned by experience and environment. (Davies et al., 2015)

  

2. The mother everywhere is normally the most important individual in the child's early life, but the nature of the relationships established between mothers and their children is influenced by the form and regularity of their contact. This is, in turn, conditioned by the character of family institutions and their relation to other groups in society. (Giddens, 2009)

  

3. Both the United States and the Soviet Union took steps at the end of World War II that were unwise or might have been avoided. Both nations, however, were working within a framework conditioned by the past. Ultimately, the rivalry between the two superpowers stemmed from their different historical perspectives and their irreconcilable political ambitions. (Spielvogel, 2010)

  

4. The spread of eating disorders reflects the influence of science and technology on our ways of life today: calorie-counting has only been possible with the advance of technology. But the impact of technology is always conditioned by social factors. (Giddens, 2009)
