1. Zola maintained that the artist must analyze and dissect life as a biologist would a living organism. (Spielvogel, 2010)

Some artists, such as Picasso and Georges Braque, in a sense emulated scientists, treating their studios like laboratories in which to analyze the very language of painting and where  each creative breakthrough served as a steppingstone to the next as they sought to develop a new model of visual perception. (Davies et al., 2015)
