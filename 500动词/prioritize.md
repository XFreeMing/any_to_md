1. Be they mental, written, or on the computer making lists of what you want to accomplish can help you prioritize and keep you focused on what needs to get done.

  

2. Let the list be your guide for what you prioritize during your working hours, making the first one on the list your most important thing.

  

3. In other words, your goal with time management is to effectively compress, organize and prioritize activities for maximum efficiency. (Williamson, 2013)

  

4. Prioritize your own wants rather than constantly thinking about others. (McConnell, Brue, & Flynn, 2014)
