1. In addition to prayer, the Cistercians devoted themselves to hard work, which helped guarantee their own great success. Sound economic planning, skill in agriculture and husbandry, and wealthy benefactors furthered their cause. At a time of rising urban growth, the serenity of the isolated sites of their monasteries must also have been attractive. (Davies et al., 2015)

  

2. The Scientific Revolution was not entirely sudden, nor were its foundations exclusively European. It owed much to a long history of empirical and theoretical inquiry that began in ancient Egypt and was furthered in China, in Hellenistic cities, and across the Muslim world. (Fiero, 2011)

  

3. To guard against military insurrection, he (Diocletian) appointed a loyal general as emperor to govern the western provinces of the Empire while he ruled the eastern regions; although both emperors bore the title Augustus, Diocletian remained superior. Constantine furthered this trend of dividing the Empire into eastern and western halves by building an imperial capital, Constantinople, at the Bosporus, a strait where Asia meets Europe. (Perry, 2010)

  

4. The railroad contributed significantly to the maturing of the Industrial Revolution. The railroad’s demands for coal and iron furthered the growth of those industries. (Spielvogel, 2010)
