1. The former (the Neoplatonic hierarchy of substances) postulated a hierarchy of substances, or great chain of being, from the lowest form of physical matter (plants) to the purest spirit (God), in which humans occupied a central or middle position. (Spielvogel, 2010)

  

2. Bergson postulated that we experience life not as a series of continuous rational moments, but as intuited random memories and perceptions that we then piece together to form ideas. (Davies et al., 2015)

(Perry, 2010)

  

4. Freud postulated a harrowing conflict between the relentless strivings of our instinctual nature and the requirements of civilization. (Perry, 2010)
