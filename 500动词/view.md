## 观看

1. Art museums are relatively new. Before the nineteenth century art was not made to be viewed in museums, so when you are looking at work in a museum, you are often viewing it out of the original context in which it was meant to be seen. (Davies et al., 2015)

> 艺术博物馆相对较新。在19世纪之前，艺术并不是为了在博物馆中观看而制作的，所以当你在博物馆中观看作品时，你经常是在它原本应该被观看的原始语境之外观看它。

3. At Northern Ireland's University of Ulster, Catholic and Protestant students viewed videos of a Protestant attack at a Catholic funeral and a Catholic attack at a Protestant funeral (Hunter & others, 1991). Most students attributed the other side's attack to "bloodthirsty" motives but its own side's attack to retaliation or self-defense. (Myers, 2012)

## 认为

1. The Parthenon is often viewed as the perfect embodiment of the Classical Doric style. (Davies et al., 2015)

2. Classical humanists saw no conflict between humanism and religious belief. They viewed their intellectual mission as both pleasing to God and advantageous to society in general. (Fiero, 2011)

3. Nevertheless, people in these early civilizations viewed themselves as subjects of states or empires, not as members of Western civilization. (Spielvogel, 2010)

4. Moreover, the growing recognition of the nonrational—of human actions determined by hidden impulses—led people to doubt that reason played the dominant role in human behavior. Other thinkers viewed the problem of reason differently. (Perry, 2010)
