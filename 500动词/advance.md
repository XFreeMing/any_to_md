## 增进；提升

1. Plato advocates essentially a system of benevolent dictatorship. But even if the dictator wants to advance the interests of the people, how are those interests to be known? (Wolff, 2006)

2. The excerpts below suggest that while humanism was an enterprise dominated by men, it provided women with the tools by which they might advance their intellectual status and voice their own complaints. (Fiero, 2011)

3. We cannot conduct true experiments with large-scale social events. But we can identify the conceptual similarities between the large scale and the small, as the astronomers have between the planets and Newton's apple. That is why the games people play in our laboratory may advance our understanding of war, peace, and social justice. (Myers, 2012)
