1. Fascists saw themselves as participants in a dynamic mass movement that would rectify the weaknesses and irresolution of parliamentary government and rid the nation of corrosive foreign influences. (Spielvogel, 2010)

  

2. As we have already noted above, Merton saw that while many sociological studies focused on either the macro-level of society as a whole or the micro-level of social interactions, this polarization had failed to 'fill in the gaps' between macro- and micro-levels. To rectify this, Merton argued for middle range theories in particular areas or on specific subjects. (Giddens, 2009)

  

3. There is a widespread view that the current international trading system is not fair to poorer countries and is constraining their economic development. A prime aim of these negotiations is to rectify this through, for example, improved access for these countries' goods and services to others' markets. (Giddens, 2009)

  

4. The classical sociologists paid little direct attention to the environment, though others have tried to rectify that omission. (Giddens, 2009)
