1. Invasions, civil wars, and plague came close to causing an economic collapse of the Roman Empire in the third century. The population declined drastically, possibly by as much as one-third. There was a noticeable decline in trade and small industry. The labor shortage created by plague affected both military recruiting and the economy. (Spielvogel, 2010)

  

2. A spiritual worldview was of fundamental importance to Mesopotamian culture. To the peoples of Mesopotamia, the gods were living realities who affected all aspects of life. (Spielvogel, 2010)

  

3. The differing political situations in Florence and Venice affected palace design. Whereas the Florentine palace was solid and impenetrable, the Venetian equivalent is airy and open, full of windows and arcades that are anything but defensible. (Davies et al., 2015)

  

4. In music and film, digital technology affected everything from the production of sound to its storage and distribution. (Fiero, 2011)
