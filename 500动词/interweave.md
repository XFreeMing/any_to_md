1. Two of the most notable of Latin America’s Magic Realists are the Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez (b. 1928) and the Chilean author Isabel Allende (b. 1943). Both are brilliant storytellers who interweave Latin America’s legendary history with universal themes of language and love. (Fiero, 2011)
