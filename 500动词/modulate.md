1. In recent German experiments in neural consciousness, patients wearing electrodes on their scalps modulate electrical signals to choose letters from a video screen—thus communicating with nothing but their own brains. (Fiero, 2011b)

  

2. Where is the line to be drawn between animals that evince morality in this limited sense and those that do not? Bekoff and Pierce suggest that the line is shifting as more empirical evidence becomes available and as our philosophical understanding of what it means to be moral is modulated by reflection on the scientific data. (Beauchamp & Frey, 2014)

  

3. Attention modulates not just ongoing perception, but also your ability to remember. Simply looking at or reading something does not ensure you will encode it, as you may know all too well while studying for exams. (Sternberg & Sternberg, 2011)

  

4. Sympathy is separated into two categories of response, the attempt made by an observer to understand and to some extent reconstruct the suffering (or joy) of another subject, and that of the sufferer to modulate his feelings to make it possible for the observer to share them. (Berry, Paganelli, & Smith, 2016)
