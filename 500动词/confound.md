## 使困惑；使惊讶

1. Early in his career, Wren held the position of chair in the astronomy department at Gresham College, London, and then professor of mathematics at Oxford University. His interest in architecture did not surface until he was about 30 years old. His technical knowledge may have affected the shape of his buildings; certainly, no previous architect had gone to such lengths to conceal a building's structural supports. Only an architect thoroughly grounded in geometry and mathematics could have achieved such results, and the technical proficiency of Wren's structures has continually confounded his critics. (Davies et al., 2015)

> 在他职业生涯的早期，雷恩在伦敦格雷沙姆学院担任天文学系主任，然后在牛津大学担任数学教授。他对建筑的兴趣直到他大约30岁时才出现。他的技术知识可能影响了他建筑的形状；当然，没有哪位先前的建筑师会如此费心地隐藏建筑的结构支撑。只有一位在几何学和数学方面有扎实基础的建筑师才能取得这样的成果，雷恩结构的技术熟练程度一直让他的批评者感到困惑。

2. In arithmetic, for example, Leonardo da Vinci made such rapid progress during the short time he studied it that he often confounded his teacher by his questions.

## 困惑；混淆

1. The State of Nature, and the State of War, which however some Men have confounded, are as far distant as a State of Peace, Good Will, Mutual Assistance, and Preservation, and a State of Enmity, Malice, Violence, and Mutual Destruction are from one another. (Wolff, 2006)

2. Art should be independent of all clap-trap——should stand alone, and appeal to the artistic sense of eye or ear, without confounding this with emotions entirely foreign to it, as devotion, pity, love, patriotism, and the like. (Davies et al., 2015)
