1. Napoleon believed in using the resources of government to stimulate the national economy and took many steps to expand industrial growth. Government subsidies were used to foster the construction of railroads, harbors, roads, and canals. (Spielvogel, 2010)

  

2. Hitler and the Nazis also established control in the economic sphere. Although the regime pursued the use of public works projects and “pump-priming” grants to private construction firms to foster employment and end the depression, there is little doubt that rearmament was a far more important contributor to solving the unemployment problem. (Spielvogel, 2010)

  

3. Before World War II, higher education had largely remained the preserve of Europe’s wealthier classes. After the war, European states began to foster greater equality of opportunity in higher education by reducing or eliminating fees, and universities experienced an influx of students from the middle and lower classes. (Spielvogel, 2010)

  

4. Managers might foster more realistic judgments by insisting that all proposals and recommendations include reasons why they might not work. (Myers, 2012)
