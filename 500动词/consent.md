1. If the goal of constructing a voluntaristic account of the state is to be achieved, then it is important that all those presently said to be bound by the state should have been able to consent to it. (Wolff, 2006)

  

2. Consider the argument that hypothetical consent somehow indicates the presence of real consent. We should start from the thought that although almost no one ever formally expresses their consent to the state, there is nevertheless a sense in which all or most of us can be said to consent. (Wolff, 2006)

  

3. The social contract thus preserves the natural rights of the governed. While individuals may willingly consent to give up some of their liberty in return for the ruler's protection, they may never relinquish their ultimate authority. (Fiero, 2011)

  

4. We would have shown how the state comes to have universal authority—authority over each one of us—by showing that everyone has consented to that authority. (Wolff, 2006)
