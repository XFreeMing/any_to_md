1. Much as we like our explanations of a phenomenon to be simple, one explanation seldom accounts for all the data. Because people are complex, more than one factor frequently influences an outcome. In group discussions, persuasive arguments predominate on issues that have a factual element (“Is she guilty of the crime?”). Social comparison sways responses on value-laden judgments (“How long a sentence should she serve?”) (Kaplan, 1989). On the many issues that have both factual and value-laden aspects, the two factors work together. Discovering that others share one’s feelings (social comparison) unleashes arguments (informational influence) supporting what everyone secretly favors. (Myers, 2012)

  

2. The art that resulted from this cultural interchange is a vibrant and vital mix. Artistic methods, materials, and traditions, introduced by migration, were combined with those that predominated in the regions where tribes settled. (Davies et al., 2015)

  

3. The median voter is the person holding the middle position on an issue: Half the other voters have stronger preferences for a public good, amount of taxation, or degree of government regulation, while half have weaker or negative preferences. The extreme voters on each side of an issue prefer the median choice rather than the other extreme position, so the median voter’s choice predominates. (McConnell, Brue, & Flynn, 2014)
