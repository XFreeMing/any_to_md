3. Due to the lack of municipal direction, city streets were often used as sewers and open drains: ‘‘In the centre of this street is a gutter, into which potato parings, the refuse of animal and vegetable matters of all kinds, the dirty water from the washing of clothes and of the houses, are all poured, and there they stagnate and putrefy. (Spielvogel, 2010)
