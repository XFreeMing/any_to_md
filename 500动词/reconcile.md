1. A third German idealist, G. W. F. Hegel (whom we met in the Preface), used idealism once again to establish a picture of the world as rational and to reconcile his interests in science and religion. (Solomon & Higgins, 2009)

  

2. After observing 2,000 couples, John Gottman (1994, 1998, 2005) noted that healthy marriages were not necessarily devoid of conflict. Rather, they were marked by an ability to reconcile differences and to overbalance criticism with affection. (Myers, 2012)

  

3. But such a sociological analysis of marriage and the family as we have just concluded strongly suggests that we will not resolve our problems by looking to the past. We must try to reconcile the individual freedoms most of us have come to value in our personal lives with the need to form stable and lasting relations with other people. (Giddens, 2009)

  

4. In everyday life, we often reconcile multiple identities (Gaertner & others, 2000, 2001). We acknowledge our subgroup identity (as parent or child) and then transcend it (sensing our superordinate identity as a family). (Myers, 2012)
