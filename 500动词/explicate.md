1. In this chapter, I will explicate the views of Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, who were the first to set this sentimentalist course. (Skorupski, 2012)

  

2. I begin by discussing the thesis of the fundamental standing of animals. I then consider some theories that might seem to account for it, and point out difficulties they face. Next, I briefly explicate the society-centered theory in order to show that it underwrites a version of the thesis of the fundamental concern of morality. Finally, I show how the society-centered theory can underwrite the thesis of the fundamental standing of animals. (Copp, 2011)

  

3. Welfarism has been ably explicated and defended by Wayne Sumner. According to the welfarist, Sumner explains, “the ultimate point of ethics is to bring about intrinsically valuable states of affairs,” and, because of this, “everyone has a reason to promote” such states of affairs, or to want them to come about. (Copp, 2011)

  

4. One way to explicate this generic idea is in terms of the conjunction of the following two claims: first, that moral obligations entail normative reasons to act, in that someone who has a moral obligation has a reason to do what it demands; second, that the person has this reason irrespective of whether doing as the obligation demands either serves or conflicts with the person’s motives. (Skorupski, 2012)
