1. Persuasion is neither inherently good nor bad. It is a message’s purpose and content that elicit judgments of good or bad. The bad we call “propaganda.” The good we call “education.” (Myers, 2012)

  

2. Dissonance theory insists that encouragement and inducement should be enough to elicit the desired action (so that attitudes may follow the behavior). (Myers, 2012)

  

3. But tension can also elicit yawning, which is commonly observed among paratroopers before their first jump, Olympic athletes before their event, and violinists waiting to go onstage. (Myers, 2012)

  

4. We have already seen, for example, how British architects evoked republican Rome in their buildings in order to elicit a sense of democracy. (Davies et al., 2015)
