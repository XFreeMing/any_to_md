1. As the next section shows, if net exports are negative, then the reductions caused by imports will outweigh the expansionary effect of exports so that domestic real GDP will decrease. (McConnell, Brue, & Flynn, 2014)

  

2. What would a utilitarian theory of political obligation look like? According to Jeremy Bentham, we should obey our rulers as long as the benefits of doing so outweigh the costs. This, then, sounds like the theory that I should obey the law if, but only if, my obedience will lead to the greater happiness of society than my disobedience. (Wolff, 2006)

  

3. Huge agricultural subsidies by Western countries to their small farm populations far outweigh the aid given to developing countries. The rich countries have repeatedly pledged to reduce the size of their farm supports. So far the amount of such subsidies has changed little in 20 years, while the amount of aid has declined. (Giddens, 2009)

  

4. The benefits of the scheme outweigh the disadvantages. (Williamson, 2013)
