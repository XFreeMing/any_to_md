1. With our material appetites continually swelling—as more people seek personal computers, refrigeration, airconditioning, jet travel—what can be done to moderate consumption by those who can afford to overconsume? (Myers, 2012)

  

2. Germany grew stronger and the German people more devoted to the fuehrer. Hitler did not moderate his ambitions, and the appeasers did not avert war. (Perry, 2010)

  

3. Talleyrand suggested that Britain, Austria, and France join in an alliance to oppose Prussia and Russia. This clever move restored France to the family of nations. Now France was no longer the hated enemy but a necessary counterweight to Russia and Prussia. Threatened with war, Russia and Prussia moderated their demands and the crisis ended. (Perry, 2010)
