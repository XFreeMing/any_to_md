1. “Auschwitz,” wrote Wiesel, “represents the negation and failure of human progress: it negates the human design and casts doubts on its validity.” (Fiero, 2011)

  

2. The benefits of the minimum wage, however, do not negate the fact that a large proportion of women still work in jobs which pay at or slightly above the minimum wage, and there are still many men and women who are employed (illegally) to work for less than the minimum wage-earnings on which it is exceedingly difficult to live, especially with dependent children. (Giddens, 2009)

  

3. Therefore, it is crucial in this age of globalism, with its heightened sense of ethnic and cultural diversity, that Westerners become sensitized to the histories and traditions of all cultures. But it is equally crucial in an era of global interdependence and tension that Westerners continuously affirm and reaffirm the core values of their heritage and not permit this priceless legacy to be dismissed or negated. (Perry, 2010)

  

4. Skeptics point to countries that have high gun ownership levels and low levels of violence to make the point that gun availability is not an important factor in the violence observed in a country. We may find nations with high gun ownership and low levels of violence or low gun ownership and high violence. A few exceptions do not negate an overall pattern showing a relationship between two factors, such as ownership levels and rates of violence. (Gabor, 2016)
