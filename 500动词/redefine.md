1. The Protestant movement spread quickly through northern Europe, as Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, and other theologians rejected papal authority and redefined Christian doctrine. (Davies et al., 2015)

  

2. The traditional framework identified seven disciplines that constituted the ‘liberal arts’, as codified in late antiquity—the three verbal arts of the trivium (grammar, rhetoric, and logic) and four mathematical arts of the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music)—which preceded the higher studies of philosophy and theology. The humanists redefined the ‘liberal arts’ as consisting of five disciplines, which they called the studia humanitatis (‘studies of humanity’). (Scott, 2018)

  

3. More recently, Organ (1997) acknowledged conceptual difficulties associated with definitional requirements that organizational citizenship behaviors are discretionary and not formally rewarded. He redefined organizational citizenship behavior according to the definition that Borman and Motowidlo (1993) suggested for contextual performance: “contributions to the maintenance and enhancement of the social and psychological context that supports task performance”. (Nezu, Nezu, Geller, & Weiner, 2012)

  

4. Since Luther downplayed the role of good works in salvation, the sacraments also had to be redefined.
