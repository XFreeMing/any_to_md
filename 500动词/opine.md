1. The subsequent conversation between Death and God, somewhat reminiscent of that between Satan and God in the Book of Job (see chapter 1), shows God to be an angry, petulant figure who finds human beings "drowned in sin." If left to their own devices, he opines, "they will become much worse than beasts." (Fiero, 2011)

  

2. Darwinism shows us that “ethics as we understand it is an illusion fobbed off on us by our genes to get us to cooperate” (Ruse and Wilson 1985: 52); and yet elsewhere Wilson opines that a proper evolutionary understanding of ethics will “make possible the selection of a more deeply understood and enduring code of moral values” (Wilson 1978: 196). (Copp, 2005)

  

3. Easterbrook opines that the behavior of judges will be “influenced, if not determined” by their understanding of the sources and functions of legislation. (Shapiro, 2013)

  

4. But this position is also too strong. There seems to be no reason why legal philosophers should not opine on the meaning of “law,” as well as the metaphysics of law. (Shapiro, 2013)
