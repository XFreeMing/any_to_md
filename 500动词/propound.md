1. Building on the romantics’ views, radical German nationalists came to propound the dangerous racist idea that national identity was an inherited characteristic—that being and feeling German depended on birth rather than acculturation. (Perry, 2010)

  

2. A completely different form of metaphysical behaviorism was developed by B. F. Skinner (1904–1990). Skinner extended to psychology the philosophy of neorealism propounded by a number of American philosophers after 1910 (Smith, 1986). (Leahey & Harris, 2000)

  

3. The storm-and-stress conception of adolescence was strongly propounded by G. Stanley Hall, the first psychologist of the modern era to write at length about adolescent development (1904). Following Hall, the major proponents of this view have been psychoanalytic theorists working within the Freudian tradition (for example, Blos, 1965; Freud, 1946, 1958). (Zimbardo & Ruch, 1992)

  

4. In the wake of the Roosevelt revolution, nearly every public policy was propounded as a right, attempting to confer constitutional status on programs like Social Security, Medicare, welfare, and food stamps. (Milkis & Rhodes, 2010)
