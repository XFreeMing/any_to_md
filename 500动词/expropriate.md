2. On overcoming Maxentius, Constantine expropriated the basilica. He gave it his own name, and placed his colossal portrait in the western apse. (Davies et al., 2015)

  

3. The libertarian, uniquely, holds that it is just as wrong for governments to take people’s money or expropriate their lands as for privately acting individuals or gangs to do so. (LaFollette & Persson, 2013)

  

4. Miners, loggers, and soldiers lured Ya̜nomami women with commodities, infecting them with sexually transmitted diseases that spread quickly into the indigenous communities. On top of prostitution, the invaders introduced alcoholism. Processing the ore, miners also polluted the rivers with mercury, poisoning fish and other creatures, including the Ya̜nomami. Within the decade, 20 percent of the Ya̜nomami died, and 70 percent of their ancestral lands in Brazil were illegally expropriated. (Haviland, Prins, McBride, & Walrath, 2013)
