1. The Encyclopedia had been undertaken in Paris during the 1740s as a monumental effort to bring together all human knowledge and to propagate Enlightenment ideas. Its numerous articles on science and technology and its limited coverage of theological questions attest to the new interests of eighteenth-century intellectuals. (Perry, 2010)

  

2. The bulk of our knowledge about Etruscan culture comes from art, and especially from their monumental tombs. These structures provide information about Etruscan building practices, and artists often painted them with scenes that reveal a glimpse of Etruscan life. Objects found within them attest to the Etruscans reputation as fine sculptors and metalworkers. (Fiero, 2011)

  

3. The centers of Minoan civilization were magnificent palace complexes, whose construction attested to the wealth and power of Minoan kings. (Perry, 2010)
