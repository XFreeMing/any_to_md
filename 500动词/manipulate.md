1. Media consumers are not 'cultural dopes' who can be manipulated effortlessly by corporate interests; as the scope and volume of media forms and content expand, individuals are becoming more, not less, skilled in interpreting and evaluating the messages and material they encounter. (Giddens, 2009)

  

2. The form or outward shape of a work of art depends on the manner in which the artist manipulates the elements of color, line, texture, and space. (Fiero, 2011)

  

3. By the 1850s, the most prevalent use of photography was for recording the world: people, sights, and objects. These pictures were generally viewed as fact, which is ironic since, as we shall see, photographers could manipulate images in various ways, including the selection of motifs and objects to be included in, or excluded from, a photograph. (Davies et al., 2015)

  

4. We can sometimes act ourselves into a frame of mind. Manipulated into a smiling expression, people feel better; when they scowl, the whole world seems to scowl back. So put on a happy face. (Myers, 2012)
