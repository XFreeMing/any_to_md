2. Yet it may be premature to conclude that the Internet will sweep aside traditional cultures, replacing them with radically new cultural values. (Giddens, 2009)

  

3. The rooms (of Palace at Knossus) were decorated with frescoes in bright colors showing sporting events and naturalistic scenes that have led some observers to conclude that the Cretans had a great love of nature. (Spielvogel, 2010)
