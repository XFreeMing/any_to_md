1. Artists manipulate form to describe or interpret the visible world (as in the genres of portraiture and landscape), or to create worlds of fantasy and imagination. They may also fabricate texts that are non-representational, that is, without identifiable subject matter. (Fiero, 2011)

  

2. By 1450, in the city of Mainz, the German goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg (ca. 1400–ca. 1468) perfected a printing press that made it possible to fabricate books more cheaply, more rapidly, and in greater numbers than ever before. (Fiero, 2011)

  

3. For centuries, the Hopi people of Arizona and the Zuni of New Mexico, both of the pueblo culture, have fabricated the small wooden figures known as kachinas.  (Fiero, 2011)

  

4. The most recent trends in the art of the Information Age involve size and spectacle, that is, public performance or theatrical display. Such art, often technically complex, may be conceived by artists but fabricated by studio assistants or professional contractors. (Fiero, 2011)
