1. Why work hard, or try to develop new products, if doing so will make a negligible impact on your income? Allowing at least some inequalities, on the other hand, will produce incentives for people to innovate and to work more productively. (Wolff, 2006)

  

2. The technologically disconnected are those regions that neither innovate nor adopt technologies developed elsewhere; they account for 35 per cent of the world's population. (Giddens, 2009)

  

3. Successful learning involves encoding and retrieval—memory in and memory out. Remembering is a necessary first step, but you need to be able to retrieve, manipulate, combine, and innovate with the information you remember. (Dirksen, 2011)

  

4. Equally damaging to children is the infamous practice of “private tuition,” where teachers accept a fee to teach well-off kids in their homes after school—a practice that creates incentives not to teach well during the normal school day. Teachers all too rarely try to innovate, to inspire children. Their highest hope is to stuff them full of facts so that they perform well on national examinations. (Nussbaum, 2016)
