1. Music plays an important role in Native American potlatches and powwows where American Indian groups gather to reaffirm and celebrate their ethnic identities. (Haviland, Prints, Walrath, & McBride, 2013)

  

2. Some theories centre on the difference in learning styles between boys and girls. Girls are often regarded as more effectively organized and motivated than boys... One manifestation of this is that girls tend to relate to one another by talking and using their verbal skills... Boys, on the other hand, socialize in a more active manner... and tend to be more disruptive in the classroom. These broad patterns of behaviour seem to be reaffirmed by teachers in the classroom, who may have lower expectations for boys than for girls, and indulge boys' disruptions by paying more attention to them. (Giddens, 2009)

  

3. Overall, the Scientific Revolution reaffirmed traditional ideas about women's nature. Male scientists used the new science to spread the view that women were inferior by nature, subordinate to men, and suited by nature to play a domestic role as nurturing mothers. (Spielvogel, 2010)

  

4. Durkheim argued that religion reaffirms people's adherence to core social values, thereby contributing to the maintenance of social cohesion. (Giddens, 2009)
