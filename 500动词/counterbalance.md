1. In the Virgin of Jeanne d Évreux, the graceful sway of the Virgin's body is counterbalanced by the harmonious way in which the drapery's vertical folds and soft curves play off each other. (Davies et al., 2015)

  

2. The galleries built over the inner aisles counterbalance the lateral pressure of the nave vault. (Davies et al., 2015)

  

3. To acknowledge the functionalism of the grid, Mies used thin I-beams for the mullions between windows. They provide the vertical accent that the proportions of the horizontal spandrels so perfectly counterbalance with their thin ridges on top and bottom. (Davies et al., 2015)

  

4. Riskier investments tend to be counterbalanced by high rewards. (McConnell, Brue, & Flynn, 2014)
