1. Wyclif alleged that there was no basis in Scripture for papal claims of temporal authority and advocated that the popes be stripped of their authority and their property. (Spielvogel, 2010)

  

2. Here, Jean-Jacques Rousseau advocated a return to nature, arguing, like Locke, that humans are born good, not in sin, and that they use their innate sense or instincts to distinguish between good and bad, that is, between what makes them happy and sad. (Davies et al., 2015)

  

3. Illich advocated what he called the deschooling of society. Compulsory schooling, he pointed out, is a relatively recent invention, and there is no reason why it should be accepted as inevitable. (Giddens, 2009)

  

4. Hoping to blend the best of individualist and collectivist values, some social scientists—myself included—have advocated a communitarian synthesis that aims to balance individual rights with the collective right to communal well-being. (Myers, 2012)
