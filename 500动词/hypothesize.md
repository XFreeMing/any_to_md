1. In ca. 480 BCE, the Aeginetans replaced the sculptures in the east pediment of their Temple of Aphaia. Scholars hypothesize that the Persian invasion of Greece may have caused damage to the earlier sculptures. (Davies et al., 2015)

  

2. In contrast with the Mesopotamians and Egyptians, who deified the sun, the rivers, and other natural elements, the pre-Socratics stripped nature of supernatural associations. They made accurate predictions of solar and lunar eclipses, plotted astronomical charts, and hypothesized on the processes of regeneration in plants and animals. (Fiero, 2011)

  

3. Proceeding from an examination of human values, Aristotle hypothesizes that happiness or “the good life” (the Greek word eudaimonia means both) is the only human value that might be considered a final goal or end (telos) in itself, rather than a means to any other end. (Fiero, 2011)

  

4. A recent set of studies examining the tendency for humans to distance themselves from other animals offers a possible way to make creatureliness especially salient. Goldenberg et al. (2001) hypothesized that MS (mortality salience) would intensify disgust reactions because, as Rozin, Haidt, and McCauley (1993) have argued, such reactions assert that we are different from and superior to mere material creatures. (Goldenber, Cox, Pyszczynski, Greenberg, & Solomon, 2002)
