1. Bluebeard’s Castle (1918), a one-act opera by the leading Hungarian composer of the twentieth century, Béla Bartók (1881–1945), did not suffer so harsh a fate, despite the fact that the composer had boldly recast a popular fairy tale into a parable of repressed tensions and jealousy between the sexes. (Fiero, 2011)

  

2. The satirist–artist Robert Colescott (1925–2009) creates parodies of famous paintings in which whites are recast as cartoon-style, stereotyped black men and women. (Fiero, 2011)

  

3. Borromini took over the project, which had been begun by another architect, Carlo Rainaldi (1611-1691), the year before, and completely recast it without, however, entirely abandoning the Greek-cross plan. (Davies et al., 2015)

  

4. The Neolithic period also marked the beginning of the use of metals. The first to be used was copper, which was easily fashioned into tools and weapons. Copper implements lasted longer than those of stone and flint, and they could be recast and reshaped if broken. (Perry, 2010)
