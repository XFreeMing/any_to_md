1. The early life experiences of the German painter Caspar David Friedrich (1774--1840) left him with a lifelong preoccupation with God and nature. Friedrich painted landscapes, but with an interest that transcended the mere presentation of natural details. His portrayal of mountains shrouded in mist, gnarled trees bathed in moonlight, and the stark ruins of monasteries all conveyed a feeling of mystery and mysticism. (Spielvogel, 2010)

  

2. Winckelmann was first, for instance, to determine that most Greek sculptures (which he often conflated with their Roman copies) represented not historical figures but mythological characters. Even more significant was his contention that Greek art captured an ideal beauty that transcended nature. (Davies et al., 2015)

  

3. As globalization progresses, existing political structures and models appear unequipped to manage a world full of the challenges that transcend national borders. (Giddens, 2009)

  

4. Hitler claimed to transcend all differences and promised to create a new Germany free of class differences and party infighting. (Spielvogel, 2010)
