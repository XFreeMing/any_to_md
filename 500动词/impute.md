1. First, many critics have argued that functionalism is good at explaining consensus why societies hold together and share a common morality - but it is much less able to explain conflict and radical social change. Others argue that Durkheimian functionalism seems to prioritize societies' constraints over people and does not allow enough room for the creative actions of individuals. Finally, functional analysis tends to impute purposes and needs to society itself. (Giddens, 2009)

  

2. By contrast, Bernard Rollins's definition of “consciousness” seems too wide: “To say that a living thing has interests is to suggest that it has some sort of conscious awareness, however rudimentary.” Rollins imputes a mental life to any creature with a nervous system, physiological pain/pleasure responses and sensory capability. (Beauchamp & Frey, 2014)

  

3. The economist may generate a “law” of behavior: Individuals will choose courses of action so as to satisfy their wants of greater subjective significance before those of lesser significance. Individuals will impute value to a commodity on the basis of the particular want satisfied by the added or lost unit of that commodity (the marginal unit). (Beauchamp & Frey, 2014)

  

4. In another line of interpretation on the division of labour issue, it has been suggested that in fact Smith imputed too much importance to labour specialization in economic development, at the expense of missing the significance of ‘mechanization’. (Berry, Paganelli, & Smith, 2016)
