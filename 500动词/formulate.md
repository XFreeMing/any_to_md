1. Historians rely primarily on documents to create their pictures of the past, but no written records exist for the prehistory of humankind. In their absence, the story of early humanity depends on archaeological and, more recently, biological information, which anthropologists and archaeologists use to formulate theories about our early past. (Spielvogel, 2010)

  

2. Poststructuralism, or deconstruction, which was formulated by Jacques Derrida (1930--2004), believes that culture is created and can therefore be analyzed in a variety of ways, according to the manner in which people create their own meaning. (Spielvogel, 2010)

  

3. During the 1920s, Schoenberg went on to formulate a unifying system for atonal composition based on serial technique. (Fiero, 2011)

  

4. Existentialism, a humanistic philosophy formulated by Jean-Paul Sartre, emphasized the role of individual choice in a world that lacked moral absolutes. (Fiero, 2011)
