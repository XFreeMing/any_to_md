1. Homosexuals are depicted as a deviant threat to the moral well-being of 'normal society'. In order to preserve heterosexual masculinity as the 'norm', it becomes necessary to marginalize and vilify the perceived threat (Rutherford and Chapman 1988). (Giddens, 2009)

  

2. Critics have attacked Beck and BeckGernsheim's exclusive focus on heterosexuality - the battle between the sexes is the 'central drama of our times' - which, critics say, marginalizes homosexual relationships. (Giddens, 2009)

  

3. The collective, communal approaches of sects and cults, some authors argue, can offer support and a sense of belonging. For example, middle-class youths are not marginalized from society in a material sense, but they may feel isolated emotionally and spiritually. Membership in a cult can help to overcome this feeling of alienation. (Giddens, 2009)

  

4. I argue that as we see the deficiencies of the contractual model of human relations within the household, we can see them also in the world beyond, and begin to think about how society should be reorganized to be hospitable to care, rather than continuing to marginalize it. (Copp, 2005)
