1. For a given scenario a number of GCMs (General Circulation Models) have run simulations covering the period 1870 through 2100 and have archived temperature and precipitation output. (O’Hagan & West, 2010)

  

2. Traditionally, media studies have ‘timed’ events by using the day that the story was on the front page of a major newspaper such as the New York Times. Theoretically, we expect the market will react much more quickly, so we need a more fine-grained measure. The Drudge Report provides that; it is constantly updated and is archived every 15 minutes. (O’Hagan & West, 2010)

  

3. Research data, particularly expensive resources, need to be archived systematically for their potential to be fully exploited through secondary analysis or by future generations of researchers wanting to build upon former findings. (Alcock, May, & Wright, 2012)

  

4. Scores of variables constitute the output of a climate model simulation, as familiar as temperature and precipitation or as esoteric as the mass of water that evaporates over an ice sheet, or metrics of ocean overturning. Many of the variables are archived as daily or monthly means, some are six-hourly, some are yearly averages.
