1. At Pompeii, wall painters sometimes used color to suggest deep space, a technique known as atmospheric or aerial perspective. This method recognizes the eye's inability to perceive color at great distances, and that specific colors become light blue or gray at the horizon line. (Davies et al., 2015)
