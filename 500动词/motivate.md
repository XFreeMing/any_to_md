1. The warriors of western Europe, particularly France, formed the first “official” crusading armies. The knights who made up this crusading host were motivated by religious fervor, but there were other attractions as well. (Spielvogel, 2010)

  

2. And, as Hobbes argues, fear and suspicion may be enough for the state of nature to tumble into war. To avoid this Locke requires not only that the state of nature be subject to moral assessment, but that somehow or other people will be motivated to act as the Law of Nature instructs. (Wolff, 2006)
