1. Oil companies have been accused of acquiescing in the pollution of the ocean. (Giddens, 2009)

  

2. Informal sanctions emphasize cultural control and are diffuse in nature, involving spontaneous expressions of approval or disapproval by members of the group or community. They are, nonetheless, very effective in enforcing a large number of seemingly unimportant customs.
