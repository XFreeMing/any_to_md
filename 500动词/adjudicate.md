1. So Hobbes would probably argue that even if people did have a natural right to punish offenders, this would rarely be used with any effect unless a single, stable, authority existed: for example, within a tribe or group an acknowledged leader to adjudicate disputes and enforce judgements. (Wolff, 2006)

  

2. There are major inconsistencies between the accounts given by different political philosophers. This raises not only the question of how to adjudicate between different accounts, but also leads to the troubling thought that a statement of what natural rights we have often seems little more than one person's opinion. (Wolff, 2006)

  

3. This view of law also has significant implications for the judiciary, whose task it is to interpret law and adjudicate between parties to a dispute. (Heywood, 2013)

  

4. The judiciary is the branch of government that is empowered to decide legal disputes. The central function of judges is therefore to adjudicate on the meaning of law, in the sense that they interpret or "construct" law. (Heywood, 2013)
