1. The two traditions of democracy and feminism share many common preoccupations, but have had a complex association. The democratic tradition long predates feminism: only in the nineteenth century did democrats begin to take seriously the issue of women's democratic rights. (Nash & Scott, 2004)

  

2. Feminist writings have emphasized a broad spectrum of topics, but three main themes are of particular importance. One of the central concerns is the domestic division of labour. the way in which tasks are allocated between members of a household. Among feminists there are differing opinions about the historical emergence of this division. Socialist feminists see it as an outcome of industrial capitalism, while others claim that it is linked to patriarchy, and thus predates the industrialization process. (Giddens, 2009)

  

3. "Terror", in the sense of the use of violence to intimidate, was used extensively in the twentieth century - for example, by the Nazis in Germany or the Russian secret police under Stalin. However, this kind of use of violence also predates the origins of the term in the French Revolution(1789). (Giddens, 2009)

  

4. Primates, elephants, dogs, and even mice also display empathy, indicating that the building blocks of altruism predate humanity. (Myers, 2012)
