1. Sometimes tensions run so high that genuine communication is impossible. In such cases, small conciliatory gestures by one party may elicit reciprocal conciliatory acts by the other party. One such conciliatory strategy, graduated and reciprocated initiatives in tension reduction (GRIT), aims to alleviate tense international situations. (Myers, 2012)

  

2. Convinced that individuals were responsible for their own misfortunes, liberals were often unmoved by the misery of the poor. Indeed, they used the principle of laissez faire—that government should not interfere with the natural laws of supply and demand—to justify their opposition to humanitarian legislation intended to alleviate the suffering of the factory workers. (Perry, 2010)

  

3. The new king, Louis Philippe (1830–1848), never forgot that he owed his throne to the rich bourgeois. And the Parisian workers who had fought for a republic and economic reforms to alleviate poverty felt betrayed by the outcome, as did the still disenfranchised petty bourgeois. (Perry, 2010)

  

4. What feminism means to people differs across the world. In parts of the developing world, feminism means working to alleviate absolute poverty and to change traditional male attitudes, which favour large families and dislike contraception, while in the developed countries, feminism means continuing campaigns for equality in employment, adequate childcare provision and the ending of male violence towards women. (Giddens, 2009)
